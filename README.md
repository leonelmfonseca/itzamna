Project: "I Want to Read" PDF Book Management Application
1. Project Overview
	Objective: Build a simple application for managing a list of PDF books users want to read.
	Features:
	User registration and authentication
	Add, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for PDF books
	Categorize books
	Mark books as read
	User-specific book lists

2. Spring Boot and Core Spring Framework
	Application Structure:
	User Service: Manages user registration, login, and profile updates.
	Book Service: Manages PDF book operations (CRUD).
	Gateway Service: Acts as an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate services.

3. Java Backend Development
	Technologies:
	Spring Boot: For building the microservices.
	Spring Data JPA: For database operations.
	Spring Security: For user authentication and authorization.
	H2 Database: For a lightweight in-memory database (for simplicity).

4. DevOps
	Practices:
		Version Control: Use Git for version control.
		Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
		Docker: Containerize each microservice using Docker.
		Kubernetes: (optional) For orchestrating the microservices.
		Monitoring and Logging: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.

5. Microservices
	Service Discovery:
	Use Eureka for service discovery.
	API Gateway:
		Use Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests to the appropriate services.
	Circuit Breaker:
		Use Resilience4j for implementing circuit breakers.
		
6. Testing and Mocking
	Unit Testing:
		Use JUnit and Mockito for unit testing.
	Integration Testing:
		Use Spring Boot Test for integration testing.
	End-to-End Testing:
		Use Cucumber or TestRest for end-to-end testing.
